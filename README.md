# RBE3002 Team 19 Lab Repository


## Weeks 1&2

- Get comfortable with creating ROS Nodes in Python and launch files.
- Get familiar with the Publisher/Subscriber Paradigm used by ROS Topics.
- Calculate mobile robot kinematics.
- Implement differential drive functionality on the TurtleBot3.
- Create a planned trajectory and track the TurtleBot3's position.


## Weeks 3&4

- Implement the A* pathfinding algorithm on a given environment map to plan paths.
- Visualize the progression of A* using RViz.
- Extract waypoints for the robot based on a calculated path.
- Gain familiarity with ROS services to establish bi-directional communication between ROS nodes.
- Demonstrate the TurtleBot3 following a path.


## Weeks 5-7 (Final Project)

- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).
- Localize the TurtleBot3 in a real environment.
- Navigate the environment and avoid obstacles.
- Find frontiers in the environment to expand the map.
- Generate and follow an optimal path to an arbitrary position.
